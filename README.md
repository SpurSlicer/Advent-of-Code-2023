# Advent-of-Code-2023
My solutions to advent of code written in C! :3
I wrote everything in C to the best of my ability. All of the code is pretty jarring, but it is possible and and somewhat doable! I am not solving these as efficiently as possible; these are just possible solutions that I have created limited to only C and my hard-coding ability.
Hopefully they are neat to look at! Everything posted here DOES work and will come with an example file (the one I was given).

## Compilation
To compile, just enter
  gcc x-y.c
and run with
  .\a.out x.txt

Hope this stuff is interesting!
